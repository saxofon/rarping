Rarping aims to be a powerful tool designed to test hosts, discover networks, stress systems, debug softs or whatever you want to do with RARP packets!

Rarping is able to send RARP requests and replies, and prints out the time elapsed from sending to reception, as most of ping-like programs.

This is a pure C written tool, originally for GNU/Linux systems.

**RARPing stable is now available!**
